block: we can put some tasks in a block and apply some configurations to that block,
for example add ignore_errors: yes in block level instead on puting it inside every task

rescue block: tasks inside rescue, will be run only if the tasks of the block failes. used to clear the task failure

always block: tasks inside always, always will be run

to have always and rescue, we have to define block

we can have multiple block,always and rescue.
