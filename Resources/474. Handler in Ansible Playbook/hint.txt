//tesk1
yum:
  name: httpd
  state: present
// if httpd package is installed on client, it does nothing,
// otw, it installs httpd (and put ture in changed field)

//task2
service:
  name: httpd
  state: started
// it starts the httpd service

// we want to run task 2, only if task1 is changed (if it is already installed, don't start it)
// way1 :
put output of task1 in a var using register
in task2 put : when: <output_var>.changed == True
// in this way, task2 or is run, or is skipped

way2 :
put task2 in handlers
in task1 add
notify :
  - <name of task2>
in this way task2 is called (by notify) only if task1.changed == True (if httpd was not inside it installed http)
in this way task2 only is called or does not called (not skipped)
